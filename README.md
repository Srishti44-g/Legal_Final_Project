## CSS and JS Architecture

The project follows a modular approach to CSS and JavaScript organization:

### CSS Organization
- **styles.css**: Contains global styles, typography, color variables, utility classes
- **navigation.css**: Sidebar, navigation menu, dropdowns, mobile menu
- **law-pages.css**: Card layouts, legal content formatting, expandable sections
- **forms.css**: Form elements, inputs, buttons, validation styles

### JavaScript Organization
- **navigation.js**: Theme switching, mobile menu, dropdown functionality
- **law-pages.js**: Expandable content, copy-to-clipboard, tooltips, smooth scrolling
- **search.js**: Search algorithm and results display
- **forms.js**: Form validation, submission handling

This modular approach improves:
- **Maintainability**: Focused files that handle specific functionality
- **Performance**: Smaller file sizes and better caching potential
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different components
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new modules for additional features
